Field created by arbitrary geometry of water droplet in uniformly applied field

#TODO
-----
- [x] read image for arbritrary geometry
- [x] convert image to vertex list
- [x] use geometry to form weighted mesh
- [ ] populate 2D array with mesh points
- [ ] set boundary conditions
- [ ] solve through over-relaxation
